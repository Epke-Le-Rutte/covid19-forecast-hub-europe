team_model_designation: primary
methods: An inverse-WIS weighted ensemble of a mechanistic model, two time series models (ARIMA, ETS) and a random walk with drift model.
data_inputs: Weekly incidence of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from the European Covid-19 forecast hub.
methods_long: For cases and deaths, an ensemble of a mechanistic model (based on EpiEstim R package), two time series models and a random walk with drift model, as implemented in the fable R package. Model weights are the inverse of the model weighted-interval scores (WIS) over the last 3 forecasts that could be evaluated. The mechanistic model for hospitalizations is a stochastic SEIR model, with a sequential Monte Carlo based inference. The estimates are solely the work of the contributors and do not necessarily represent, nor are endorsed by, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
